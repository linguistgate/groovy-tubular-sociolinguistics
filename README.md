# groovy-tubular-sociolinguistics
This is a lesson intended to encourage students to think systematically about
how they use language and to guide them in developing tools to analyze their
own speech and the speech of others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways. It's
important for students to learn that language use is very diverse and people
of different communities use different formal means of expressing ideas of
equal importance. By learning about how they speak on a more conscious
level, students will be poised to listen more closely to how people with whom
they interact daily speak and express themselves, and they will be given the
opportunity to see these differences as a springboard for further
investigation of linguistic diversity.
